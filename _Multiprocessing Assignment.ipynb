    "ANS: Multiprocessing in Python refers to the technique of using multiple processes to perform tasks concurrently or in parallel. Python's multiprocessing module allows you to create and manage multiple processes, each of which runs independently and can execute its own code. This is in contrast to multithreading, where multiple threads share the same memory space and can access the same data, which can lead to complex synchronization and race condition issues.\n",
    "Improved Performance: By running tasks in parallel processes, you can take advantage of multi-core processors and significantly improve the performance of CPU-bound tasks. This can lead to faster execution times for tasks that can be divided into parallel subtasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation: Each process runs in its own separate memory space, which provides isolation between processes. This isolation makes it easier to write concurrent code without worrying about shared memory issues and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fault Tolerance: If one process crashes due to an error, it typically does not affect other processes. This enhances the robustness of your applications since a crash in one part of the program won't necessarily bring down the entire application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing Multiple Cores: Modern computers often have multiple CPU cores. Multiprocessing allows you to utilize these cores effectively, distributing the workload across them to achieve better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism: Multiprocessing is particularly useful for tasks that can be divided into smaller, independent subtasks that can be executed in parallel. For example, tasks like data processing, scientific computing, and simulations can benefit greatly from multiprocessing."
