    "ANS: The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Encapsulation:Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, providing control over the data's integrity and preventing unintended interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Abstraction:Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors of objects while ignoring the non-essential details. It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (called a superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where subclasses can inherit and extend the functionality of their parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects and allows functions or methods to work with objects of different classes in a consistent way. Polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding and interfaces/abstract classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars form the foundation of object-oriented programming and are essential for creating modular, maintainable, and extensible code."
