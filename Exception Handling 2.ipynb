    "ANS: Exception class or one of its subclasses. Here's why you should use the Exception class as the base class for custom exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: By inheriting from Exception or its subclasses, you ensure that your custom exception class follows the same conventions and interfaces as the standard exceptions in Python. This makes it consistent with the built-in exceptions, which makes it easier for others to understand and use your custom exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compatibility: Most exception handling mechanisms in Python are designed to work with exceptions that are subclasses of Exception. When you raise a custom exception that is derived from Exception, you can use it seamlessly with try-except blocks and other error-handling constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarity: Inheriting from Exception or a relevant subclass provides a clear and well-defined structure for your custom exception. It makes your code more readable and understandable for others who may encounter your exception in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Practice: It is a best practice in Python to use the built-in exception classes as base classes for custom exceptions. This practice is recommended in the Python documentation and widely followed in the Python community."
